 __Description__
The course project is implemented by a real estate agency web service. 
The main idea is the purchase and sale of real estate, including apartments, houses, and land plots. 
The service provides the ability to search for real estate according to various criteria, such as price, area, number of rooms and location (distance from the metro, for example). 
On the site you can find information about the market value of real estate, as well as compare your favorite listings.
